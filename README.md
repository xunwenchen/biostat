# biostat
Dear students,
This is the R codes for the course of biostatistics that I teach.

Please download and install R and RStudio, then download the nonpara.R file, which can be run in RStudio in your computer.
Currently, there is only one file on non-parametric test. You may use it together with the PPT/lecture note distributed.

If any questions, please contact xchenat [at] connect.ust.hk
